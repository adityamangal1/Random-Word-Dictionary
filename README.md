# api-project

## The challenge: 
* Combine two separate API calls in a single application 

## The end product: 
* I used client-side JS and fetch calls. 
* I generate a word using the random-word-api and embed that data into my dictionaryapi call using a template literal. 
* The result will display to the screen after you press the 'Random Word Generator' button. 

APIs I used were: <br>
* https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home <br>
* https://dictionaryapi.com/products/api-collegiate-dictionary

## Conclusion: 
* While the execution is very simple, it meets the requirements of the challenge. 
* For anyone still learning how to use APIs, feel free to fork and poke around the code. 
* Feel free to run the app locally by removing the import statement in the script.js file and inputting your dictionaryapi api-key.
